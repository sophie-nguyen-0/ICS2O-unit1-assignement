          <h2>1815 – 1852</h2>
          <h3>English mathematician and writer</h3>
          <h4>
            “The more I study, the more insatiable do I feel my genius for it to
            be.”
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Ada Lovelace was one of the influential mathematicians and English
            writers of her time. She has written instructions for the first
            computer program in the mid 1800s. She also wrote the program for
            Charles Babbage’s mechanical computer, the analytical engine. She
            was born on December 10, 1815 to the poet Lord Byron and Anne
            Isabella Milbanke.
            <br />
            She was also the only legitimate child of her father but had no
            relationship with her father. Lord Byron left his wife and daughter
            continuing his affair with a stage actress and died when Ada was
            just nine years old.

          <h5>Quick facts!:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ada Lovelace is credited with writing the first algorithm that was
              meant to be processed by a machine.
            </li>
            <li>
              She was the first one to realize that a computer would be able to
              do more than just performing mathematical calculations.
            </li>
            <li>
              She conceptualized a flying machine after studying the anatomy of
              birds at the age of 12 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Her mother Anne Isabella Milbanke was also a mathematics wiz. She
              was also known as the Princess of Parallelograms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ada married William King-Noel, the first Earl of Lovelace. She is
              also known as the ‘Countess of Computing’.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is also a computer programming language which is named in
              Ada Lovelace’s honour. It was developed during the 1970s by the
              U.S. Department of Defense.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lovelace died on November 27, 1852 due to uterine cancer. She was
              36 years old at that time.
            </li>
            <li>
              She was buried next to her father at her request who also passed
              away at the age of 36 years.
