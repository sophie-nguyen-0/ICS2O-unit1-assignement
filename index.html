    <p>Ada Lovelace was one of the influential mathematicians and English writers of her time. She has written instructions 
       for the first computer program in the mid 1800s. She also wrote the program for Charles Babbage’s mechanical 
       computer, the analytical engine. She was born on December 10, 1815 to the poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella 
       Milbanke. <br></br>She was also the only 
       legitimate child of her father but had no relationship with her father. Lord Byron left his wife and daughter 
       continuing his affair with a stage actress and died when Ada was just nine years old.</p>
